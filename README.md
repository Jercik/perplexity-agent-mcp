## Perplexity Agent MCP

An MCP server that gives your coding assistant access to Perplexity AI through two tools: `lookup` for quick fact-checking and `answer` for in-depth research with recommendations.

### Setup

First, install and link the server:

```bash
npm install
npm link
```

Then add it to your Claude config file (`~/.claude.json` or `~/.config/claude/config.json`):

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "perplexity": {
    "command": "perplexity-agent-mcp",
    "env": {
      "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code after saving, and you're ready to go.

### How it works

The server provides two tools:

- **lookup**: Gets quick facts from documentation (like API syntax or config keys)
- **answer**: Does deeper research to compare options and make recommendations

Both tools return clean, focused answers without any internal reasoning clutter. The server picks the right AI model for each jobâ€”fast for lookups, thorough for research.

### Requirements

- Node.js v24 or newer
- A Perplexity API key
